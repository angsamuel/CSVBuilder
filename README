kureha.py is the python script you'll want to run. 

To generate a csv for the datasets run as: 

	python kureha.py <inputfile> <testname>

For example
	
	python kureha.py ./samples/input1.txt fluidanimate

This should generate a CSV with a timestamp and plop it in the results folder.

The input file should contain a file path to a data file on each line. 
See input1.txt in the samples folder for help.
I'll tweak this later so you have more options.
